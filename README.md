This project is a .NET MAUI application, structured to promote maintainability and scalability. It primarily follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, which separates the application's UI (Views) from its business logic (ViewModels) and data (Models).

### Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

*   **`API`**: Contains interfaces and implementations for interacting with external APIs. This includes services for making network requests and models for API responses.
*   **`Controls`**: Houses custom UI controls that can be reused across different views in the application.
*   **`Converters`**: Contains value converters used in XAML bindings to transform data from the ViewModel to the View, or vice-versa.
*   **`Helpers`**: Includes utility classes and extension methods that provide common functionalities and simplify code.
*   **`Models`**: Defines the data structures and business entities used throughout the application. These models represent the data that the application works with.
*   **`Platforms`**: Contains platform-specific code and configurations for Android, iOS, MacCatalyst, Tizen, and Windows. This is where platform-specific manifest files, entry points, and resources are located.
*   **`Resources`**: Stores application assets such as app icons, fonts, images, splash screens, and global styles (colors, styles).
*   **`ViewModels`**: Contains classes that act as an abstraction of the View. ViewModels expose data from the Model to the View and handle the View's presentation logic and commands.
*   **`Views`**: Contains the user interface definitions, primarily written in XAML, with corresponding code-behind files for UI-specific logic (though most logic should reside in ViewModels).

### Coding Style and Practices

*   **MVVM Architecture**: The project strictly adheres to the MVVM pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.
    *   **Models**: Plain C# objects representing data.
    *   **Views**: XAML files defining the UI, bound to ViewModels.
    *   **ViewModels**: C# classes exposing data and commands to Views, interacting with Models and Services.
*   **XAML for UI**: User interfaces are defined using XAML, leveraging data binding to connect UI elements with ViewModel properties and commands.
*   **C# for Logic**: All application logic, including business rules, data manipulation, and API interactions, is implemented in C#.
*   **Naming Conventions**:
    *   Classes, interfaces, and public members generally follow **PascalCase** (e.g., `ApiService`, `LoginViewModel`, `ProductDetail`).
    *   Private fields often use an underscore prefix (e.g., `_apiService`).
    *   XAML files for Views and Controls are named descriptively (e.g., `HomePageView.xaml`, `CreditCardView.xaml`).
*   **Resource Management**: Centralized management of UI resources (colors, styles, images, fonts) in the `Resources` folder promotes consistency and ease of modification.
*   **API Abstraction**: The `API` folder with interfaces (`IApiService`) and concrete implementations (`ApiService`) ensures a decoupled and testable approach to API communication.

### Building the Project

This is a standard .NET MAUI project. To build and run the application, you will need the .NET SDK (specifically for MAUI development) installed.

1.  **Restore Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```
2.  **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    dotnet build NYC.MobileApp.csproj
    ```
3.  **Run on a Specific Platform (Example for Android)**:
    ```bash
    dotnet build NYC.MobileApp.csproj -t:Run -f net8.0-android
    ```
    Replace `net8.0-android` with `net8.0-ios`, `net8.0-maccatalyst`, `net8.0-windows`, or `net8.0-tizen` for other platforms.
